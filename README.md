# Learning Ninja (Client)

This repo contains server-side code for Learning Ninja, which is an app that makes learning math fun and accessible. Built with Angular 1

## The Big Idea

The app hopes to:

- make learning math fun and addictive through gamification
- maximise learning by engaging both the left brain (logic and words) and the right brain (imagination and visuals)
- provide unlimited quests and questions on topics covered by PSLE, 'O' and 'N levels'
- provide immediate feedback on what the user knows/doesn't know
- encourage active learning through guided hints
- reduce teachers' workload (no marking needed!)

## Dependencies

This app is built on Angular 1.5, with the help of awesome components from Angular Material.
